So Philander and Maharaj are out there doing just Philander and Maharaj things. They are resisting everything that the Indian bowlers are throwing at them, and unlike the last time the duo took to the crease, it is  Philander who is being the aggressor, dispatching the loose balls to the boundary while Maharaj is playing some classic risk averse cricket. Rohit Sharma was brought in to roll over his arm, which was certainly an interesting sight to see. No damage done by him though. The umpires have called for Tea, and South Africa go into the break with the score at 172/7.
