OUT! Jadeja traps Keshav Maharaj in front of the stumps, who immediately goes up for a review. However,  the ball is shown crashing straight into leg-stump, and with that, India have sealed their victory by an innings and 137 runs. They have also registered a 2-0 win in the Test series, and it is their 11th straight Test series win at home, breaking the record of ten set by Australia. Dominance by the home side!
